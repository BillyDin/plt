## Release 4.final 

## Get Started

Clone the repository
```sh 
$ git clone https://github.com/BillyDin/plt.git
```
## Install dependencies

```sh
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install python python3 libmicrohttpd-dev lcov libsfml-dev gcc cmake make libxml2-dev dia lcov libboost-all-dev gcovr python-pip \
   && pip install gcovr
```

## Build

```sh
$ cd plt
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. && make
```

## Print

```sh
$ ./bin/client hello
```

## Test

```sh
$ cd ./plt/build
$ make code-coverage
```

## Print a rendering

```sh
$ ./bin/client render
```

## Run the engine

```sh
$ ./bin/client engine
```

## Make a roll back

```sh
$ ./bin/client rollback
```

## Play vs Random AI

```sh
$ ./bin/client random_ai
```
## Play vs Heuristic AI

```sh
$ ./bin/client heuristic_ai
```
## Play vs Deep AI

```sh
$ ./bin/client deep_ai
```

## Random AI vs Random AI

```sh
$ ./bin/client raivsrai
```
## Heuristic AI vs Heuristic AI

```sh
$ ./bin/client haivshai
```
## Deep AI vs Deep AI

```sh
$ ./bin/client daivsdai
```

## Deep AI vs Deep AI with the engine in a different thread
```sh
$ ./bin/client thread
```

## Make IAs play the game for 12 turns and save all commands in "replay.txt"
```sh
$ ./bin/client record
```

## Play the game through the record stored in "replay.txt"
```sh
$ ./bin/client play
```

## Start the server and connect 2 players to it

### In a first bash
```sh
$ ./bin/server listen
```

### In a second bash
```sh
$ ./bin/client network_final
```

### In a third bash
```sh
$ ./bin/client network_final
```

## Start the server, connect 2 players to it, launch the game with DeepAI vs Deep AI

### In a first bash
```sh
$ ./bin/server listen
```

### In a second bash
```sh
$ ./bin/client network_final
```

### In a third bash
```sh
$ ./bin/client network_final
```
